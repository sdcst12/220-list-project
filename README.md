# 220-list-project
* To create a basic program that will generate random data (eventually lots of random data) to populate a massive record that we will store offline.
* To use the random module to help us create random data
* Use a more complicated algorithm to generate data

We are going to use the handout in class and follow the basic star system generation
checklist starting with step 2 and working our way down to the end of step 6.

We will be generating
* starport type
* check for naval base
* check for scout base
* check for gas giant
* generate a random name ( you can use a random set of numbers or create a library of words/letters.  The name of the system in the Alien movie franchise, fore example, was LV427)
* skip step 4 (no travel zone code needed)
* generate size, atmosphere, hydrographics, population, government level, law level and tech level
* note that there are modifiers to your generated values based on some of your previous values
* 1D represents a random number from 1-6.
* 2D represents a random number from 2-12, the sum of 2 dice rolls
* DM represents a modifer to the dice roll, either adding or subtracting values

Assignment Expected Output
Your program for today should generate a dictionary that stores the data you generate.

What comes next?
You will be using a while or for loop to generate multiple data entries to store in a list that we will eventually be writing to a file in JSON format so that we can open and decode it later.
